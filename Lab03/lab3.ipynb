    "In this exercise, you will be introduced to standard techniques for unsupervised ML used also for EDA. These include the k-means clustering algorithm and manifold-learning techniques, such as multi-dimensional scaling (MSD) and t-SNE. This exercise aims to practice these techniques for discovering and visualising hidden patterns in data.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this exercise you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply a clustering algorithm for partitioning a data set into clusters of similar examples.\n",
    "Use a manifold-learning technique to visualise a clustered data set with 3 or more numerical attributes as a 2D scatter plot.\n",

    "### Task 1\n",
    "Download the following dataset and example notebooks:\\\n",

    "\n",
    "### Task 2\n",
    "Follow the example notebooks to cluster either the loans_train dataset or the bank dataset after it has been prepared for ML (i.e. the result of Lab 2). That is, there is no need to use a data preprocessing pipeline. Use the k-means clustering algorithm and visualise the clustering. Pick a value of k suggested by MDS and t-SNE visualisations of the dataset. Experiment with various values of the parameters of k-Means. Aim at producing a meaningful clustering that allows you to describe the clusters with words. Write a short conclusion about the characteristics of the clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 3\n",
    "Plot the sum of squared distances from the data points to the k-Means clusters' centres for various values of k. Use the Elbow method to pick the best value of k. If it suggests a different value of k (from the one you used in Task 2), compute a new k-Means clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 4\n",
    "Implement and plot the results of the Silhouette method for determining the best value of k for k-Means. Compare the results of the Elbow method to the results of the Silhouette method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 5\n",
    "Apply another clustering algorithm (from the ones available in scikit-learn, e.g. DBSCAN) to the same dataset and an appropriate manifold-learning technique to visualise the clustering."
